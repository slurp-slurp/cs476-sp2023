NOTE: All analytics done by Hive; no source code, class files, jar, etc.

1.create and describe tables
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS tweets;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE tweets(user_id STRING, tweet_id STRING, tweet STRING, has_anymore BOOLEAN) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED AS TEXTFILE location  'hdfs://nyu-dataproc-m/user/mx626_nyu_edu/project/input/cleaned/tweets' tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="0");

describe tweets;
select * from tweets limit 5;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS user_location;
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE user_location(user_id STRING, location STRING) ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY '\t' STORED AS TEXTFILE location  'hdfs://nyu-dataproc-m/user/mx626_nyu_edu/project/input/cleaned/user_loc' tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="0");

describe user_location;
select * from user_location limit 5;

2.find distinct
select count(distinct location) from user_location;
select distinct location from user_location limit 10;

select count(*) from 
(select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id) as joined_tb;

select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id limit 10;

3. count text data
select count(*) from (select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id) as joined_tb 
where has_anymore = true;

select count(*) from (select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id) as joined_tb 
where has_anymore = true and tweet REGEXP "^(?!.*(few|little|n¡¯t|idc|idk|barely|rarely|hardly|does|do|what|why|how|when|where|who|nt|no|not|n't|never))(?=.*anymore).*$" and not (tweet like "%anymore?%");

select location, count(*) from (select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id) as joined_tb
where has_anymore = true and tweet REGEXP "^(?!.*(few|little|n¡¯t|idc|idk|barely|rarely|hardly|does|do|what|why|how|when|where|who|nt|no|not|n't|never))(?=.*anymore).*$" and not (tweet like "%anymore?%")
group by location;

4. other analytics I need
select location, tweet from (select distinct t.user_id as user_id, t.tweet as tweet, t.has_anymore as has_anymore, u.location as location from tweets t join user_location u on t.user_id = u.user_id) as joined_tb 
where has_anymore = true and tweet REGEXP "^(?!.*(few|little|n¡¯t|idc|idk|barely|rarely|hardly|does|do|what|why|how|when|where|who|nt|no|not|n't|never))(?=.*anymore).*$" and not (tweet like "%anymore?%")  
order by location;
